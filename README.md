Overview

This project provides a clean, efficient implementation of the Fibonacci sequence in Python. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

The implementation uses an iterative approach which is:
- More memory efficient than recursive solutions
- Faster for large sequences
- Easier to understand for beginners

 Installation

No installation is required as this is a standalone Python script. However, you need:

- Python 3.x
- (Optional) A virtual environment

To get started:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fibonacci-sequence.git
cd fibonacci-sequence
```

## Usage

Import the function and call it with the desired number of Fibonacci numbers:

```python
from fibonacci import fibonacci

# Get first 10 Fibonacci numbers
sequence = fibonacci(10)
print(sequence)
```

Command line execution:
```bash
python fibonacci.py
```

## Features

- Generates Fibonacci sequences of any length
- Handles edge cases (n ≤ 0, n = 1, n = 2)
- Clean, well-documented code
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)

## How It Works

The algorithm:
1. Initializes the sequence with [0, 1]
2. Handles special cases where n ≤ 2
3. For n > 2:
   - Iterates from 2 to n-1
   - Each new number is the sum of the last two numbers
   - Appends the new number to the sequence
4. Returns the complete sequence

## Examples

```python
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
print(fibonacci(10)) # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
print(fibonacci(1))  # Output: [0]
print(fibonacci(0))  # Output: []
```
